# Formating Code in Word

To format your code in Word in a clean way do the following.

Open The Insert Tab and go to the section Text and Click on Object.

There Scroll down and select Open Document Text. 

![Microsoft Word Select Open Document in Dialog](https://github.com/LuckyCrasher/TippsnTricks/blob/main/FormatingCode/Images/OpenDocumentText_Word.png "Object Dialog")

Click on OK to insert the new Object. A new Word Window will open up.
Paste your Code from your Editor/IDE into there. Make sure that it copies with the
highlighting information.

Save with Ctrl + s and close the Window.
This should be enough to display the Code in the Document. The Block now behaves like a Image.

To spice things up, right click on the Block and go down to Image (Bild).

There I like to change the Background color to make the code more Visible.

And add some space to make just a bit cleaner.

The finished result is nice and clean.
